Creating services that helps health organizations across the globe share important patient information quickly and with better confidence and trust.",

Working in C# and the Unity engine building prototypes or reverse engineer a game mechanic I find intrigueing. You'll also frequently find me hacking away on absurd ideas at the nearest available Game Jam. Creating that tower defense dating sim you never knew you wanted.",
    "paragraphThree": "Occasionally I can be found visiting the outside world for huu-man interaction. Sometimes in the form of hiking and skiing when the weather permits; but more often you'll find me at the local board game bar, an up-and-coming venue trend I am eternally grateful for.",
