  <h1>Ryan Cross</h1>
  <h3>Software Engineer x Game Developer</h3>

  <p>
    Welcome. I'm Ryan and I'm a senior software engineer by day. I've spent the last few years in the HealthCare IT
    space @ Cerner; Building robust APIs and web applications for a range of healthcare concepts. Recently, I've been
    fortunate enough to work with a team of extremely talented engineers. Creating services that will help health
    organizations everywhere share important patient information quicker and with better confidence and trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    By night, my productive efforts shift towards my long-term dream of building games. Usually working in C# and the
    Unity engine on fun prototypes or game mechanics I'm trying to reverse engineer. You'll also frequently find me
    hacking away on absurd ideas at the nearest available Game Jam. Creating that tower defense dating sim you never
    knew you wanted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes I visit the outside world for huu-man interaction. Sometimes in the form of hiking and skiing when the
    weather permits; but more often you'll find me at the local board game bar, an up-and-coming venue trend I am
    eternally grateful for.
  </p>

    it's mostly games), check out the projects page.
